# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-02

Dependency fix. **0.1.0 is broken for a fresh install** — upgrade.

- Cap the `mcp` SDK below 2.0. The SDK published 2.0.0 and moved
  `mcp.server.fastmcp`, which every vertical imports at module load, so an
  unbounded `mcp>=1.0` made any new resolve pick a version that fails to import
  before a single request runs. Existing environments were unaffected only
  because their venv already held a 1.x.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-25

First public release on PyPI.

The Cogno business verticals as standalone MCP servers (the product layer). Each vertical is an independent FastMCP server the host orchestrates via cogno-mcp; verticals own their domain logic + data behind their own store ports. Verticals: scheduler (agenda → SECRETARY persona) and bookkeeper (finance → BOOKKEEPER persona).
